Problem 6.

(a)
The test failed when it tried to evaluate fib(0).
0 is a non-negative number and defined in the fibonacci series to be 1. 
Therefore it does not belong in the throw exception block.

(b)
The recursive calls hit the base case of fib(0) which raises the exception.

(c)
That test was testing if fib did what it was suppose to, it didnt at first.
Instead it was subtracting values. It should be adding those terms.

Problem 7. 

(a) Wrong constructor, need to specify what volume is which.
    Wrong return from getVolume.
   
(b) The 1st approach is better. It is more modular and orthogonal. Each function does exactly what
    it is intended to do; no more and no less. Just attempting to implement the second approach I had to 
    changed all of the methods to update the volume which can lead to bugs when you come back and add more
    functions, etc.

(c) Approach 1: Change Box to use a different BoxContainer which is implemented using a TreeSet instead of a 
    LinkedHashSet. Then we return Box.iterator() iterates over the elements in the set in ascending order.
    Approach 2: Copy over the data in the set to an external data structure that can be sorted and return an
    iterator.
    Approach 1 is the better approach (although I did not implement it this way). Since Box contains the
    method getBallsFromSmallest(), it is an important function to the class. If we change the underlying data
    structure of Box to use a TreeSet then it will make this method cheaper and faster. The LinkedHashSet 
    prioritizes the order and that elements are added which is irrelevant to the functionality of Box.
