Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)
  
StringNode:
  Allows empty string as a valid data value. I noticed that there were empty Strings for the
  character list for some of the comic books in marvel.tsv.
  
StringGraph:
  this.nodes changed from private to protected so when I extend StringGraph I can override methods that access this.nodes
  checkRep is changed from private to protected so I can call it from MarvelPaths.
