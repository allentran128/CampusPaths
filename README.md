# CampusPaths

This application visually displays the shortest route between buildings on the University of Washington Campus.

I used a Model-View-Controller design pattern to structure this application.

Model:
  Implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm to find shortest path.
  
View:
  Used Java's GUI API to draw the graphics interface.
  
Controller:
  The bridge between the visual display and the underlying mechanism of this application.
